# jmanager - A(nother) jail manager

## Introduction

So another jail manager? Well, there is no jail manager with
web interface or provisioning. This project is meant to use
several tools to just offer something intuitive to be used
for jail management.

This manager uses ansible for jail provisioning.

## Requirements

- ansible
- FreeBSD (sorry, but this is a *jail* manager)
- At least one pool with ZFS.
